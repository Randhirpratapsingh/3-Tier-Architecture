# 3-Tier Web Application with Load Balancer

A project demonstrating a **3-tier architecture** (Web → App → Database) with a load balancer to improve performance, security, and scalability.


##  Architecture

- **Web Tier**: Receives user requests, handles static content or forwards to application tier  
- **App Tier**: Implements business logic, API endpoints  
- **Database Tier**: Stores persistent data  
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across web servers
